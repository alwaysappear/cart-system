# cart-system

Here, I will be building a cart system using useReducer Hook in React & Typescript.

It's going to have Total Price, Clear All Items, Delete Individual Item, Increment and Decrement of Quantity, and the total Item(s) in the cart which is going to be displaying at the top of the cart icon.

I built a similar one in an Ecommerce website but with React JS and it wasn't useReducer and it's working perfectly fine. Here: <https://github.com/alwaysappear/comfy-react>
